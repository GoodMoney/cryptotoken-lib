# What Is it?
This library will provide an abstraction layer giving a general purpose interface on top of the major interactions with crypto-tokens across multiple cryptocurrency blockchains and networks.  The major operations required for a token are accounted for.  Initially, it will support ERC20 standard, with emphasis on what will be required to support tokens across multiple blockchains.


# Using cryptotoken-lib

```python
from cryptotoken-lib import *

network = Ethereum.Network("127.0.0.1:8545")
token = EthereumToken()
token.send(to="0x98234f...", amount=Decimal(35.300))
```

## Ethereum
In Ethereum, ERC20 defines the transfer function as:
`transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data)`


### Connecting to a particular Ethereum provider

#### HTTP
You can set the environment variable WEB3_PROVIDER_URI before starting your script, and web3 will look for that provider first.

```bash
export WEB3_PROVIDER_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8545
python my_program.py
```

Valid formats for the this environment variable are:

file:///path/to/node/rpc-json/file.ipc
http://192.168.1.2:8545
https://node.ontheweb.com
ws://127.0.0.1:8546


#### Infura
To connect to the Infura Mainnet remote node, first register for a free API key if you donâ€™t have one at https://infura.io/signup .

Then set the environment variable INFURA_API_KEY with your API key:

```bash
export INFURA_API_KEY=YourApiKey
python my_program.py
```

# Discussion

There are several intrinsic variables derived from making the call, including:
* Source address / where to subtract the balances from. This is gleaned from the key used to sign the transaction.
* Token address. This is found because the token code is deployed at the address where the transaction is calling a function.
* Callback: This is specific to ERC223, and is encoded in the data parameter.






# Low-Level API

```python
network = GetNetwork("Ethereum", "json-rpc", "192.168.67.124:8545")
unsignedTx = network.buildTransfer({
    'token': "0x9d36a...",
    'sender': "0x145f...",
    'recipient': "0x932ec2...",
    'amount': 194850000000000000000000 # denominated in wei
})

signedTx = senderPrivateKey.sign(unsignedTx)
network.broadcastRawTx(signedTx)

```

# Network Protocol Adapters
## Ethereum json-rpc

The library we use for interacting with Ethereum's RPC interface is called "web3".
In order to interact with contract source code, you will need the solidity compiler
Mac OS X:
`brew install solidity`

# High-Level API
Utilizing the above data structures, we are able to look up and construct some nice high-level calls.

> TODO: Evaluate whether to include the db, lookups, and higher-level API in this library or split out into a higher-level library.

```python
network = GetNetwork("Ethereum", "mainnet", "json-rpc")
token = GetToken('OMG')
duke = GetUserByName("Duke Jones")
nick = GetUserByName("Nick Sullivan")

network.buildTransfer(token, duke, nick, "194.357") # Amount is a decimal-style representation in the precision defined in the smart contract.
```
